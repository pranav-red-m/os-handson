Ok so right now we are doing bash scrips and ocmmands most baics are shells and shell variables and envirnoment variables and entering a child shell. Now lets do some bash scrips the most basic of them is if a file exists inn the directory
if [-f wel.exe]
then
echo "File Exists"
else
echo "File Does not exists"
fi

Now lets do for loops in tghe bash directoryu
for i in {1..5}
do
echo "i=$i"
done

obvio yuo can do nested for loops also
